# A Sustainable Future

‘Āina Vis is a public dataset of a historical index of ‘aina organizations from 1908-2021 in Hawai‘i, which are organizations dedicated to the concept of ‘Āina (land, that which feeds) in Hawai‘i.
This community page is an example of how the dataset can be utilized once downloaded from our public site, which is in progress.

The dataset referenced here was compiled by [KUA](http://kuahawaii.org/), [Consuelo Foundation](http://consuelo.org/), and [DOFAW](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dofaw/).

Excerpted from the work -in-progress public site:
>*PROJECT INTRO:
>ʻĀINA translated from ’Ōlelo Hawaiʻi (Hawaiian language) into English means land, or that which feeds. “VIS” is short for vision, and also means power; in relation to; as compared with; face-to-face with; together. This dataset named ʻĀina Vision is about ʻāina power, ʻāina face-to-face, and ʻāina together.*

>*This humble webpage is a start to a full website in the works, which currently serves as a preliminary public dataset of ʻāina organizations across Pae ʻĀina (Hawaiian islands) in a format that can be easily combined with other datasets to facilitate further research and inquiry pertaining to ʻāina work.*

>*While in the future, a living directory of organizations working on ʻāina may emerge, for now our intent is to simply encourage the representation of ʻāina work as important contributors to public health and economy in Hawaiʻi. As a tool, the dataset may assist in recognizing the existing network of ʻāina organizations to facilitate partnerships with on-the-ground, place-based efforts that can increase local capacity for climate resilience and culture resurgence rooted for Pae ʻĀina Hawaiʻi by Pae ʻĀina Hawaiʻi.*
