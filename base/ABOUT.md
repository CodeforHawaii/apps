## About our Sustainable Community Project

**Project Impact**

Our project makes a real-world impact in addressing the challenge by getting these orgs “on the map”, making this incredibly powerful social infrastructure ‘visible’ as it is often not seen or considered along side the formal agency infrastructure nor is it appreciated as a critical component of environmental and human wellbeing.


**Integration**

Our project allows us to see where there are ‘hotspots’ of stewardship and where there are gaps, so we can learn from places/people where collaborations are strong, and also begin to formulate questions/ hypotheses about why gaps appear in other places.
